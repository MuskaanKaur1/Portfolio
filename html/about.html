                        I’m a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc. IT), passionate about turning ideas into digital solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained experience in web development, databases, networking, and programming. I enjoy learning new technologies. Now that I’ve completed my final exams, I’m excited to take the next step in my career and explore opportunities in the tech industry.

                <p>
                    I’ve built several hands-on projects including a full-stack eCommerce platform, a chatbot, and a real-time chat app. These experiences helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and gain confidence in full-stack development. Currently, I’m seeking opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to a tech-driven team.

                    Outside of coding, I enjoy drawing, creative work like crafting. I’ve lived in Mumbai with my family since childhood, and the vibrant energy of the city continues to inspire my creativity and ambition.
